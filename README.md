# rotate-a-linkedlist-java
here we can create a LinkedList and rotate it to 'N' no. of time\
when we run this code at starting it asked for\
***how many element you want to insert***\
then insert the valve of 'N'\
then insert the value of 'N' element one by one\
then it asked for ***how many rotation you want to do***\
then insert the value and then it generate the rotated linkedlist
<br>
## ***For example***
we have created a linked list as\
***1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->null***
<br>
and we want it rotate to 3 no. of time\
<br>
# ***Output***
***4->5->6->7->8->1->2->3->null***
